# Rolls-Royce Digital Twin – Predictive Maintenance & Agentic AI
## Overview

This is more than just a data science project — it’s a story of innovation, inspired by Rolls-Royce’s IntelligentEngine vision.
A few months ago, I became fascinated with how Rolls-Royce builds intelligent engines that "talk back" — digital twins that predict and communicate when something will break, long before it actually does.

So I built one myself.

This platform simulates an intelligent aircraft engine environment:
- Predicts Remaining Useful Life (RUL) with machine learning
- Uses a LangChain-powered AI agent to make autonomous decisions
- Generates GPT-based natural language maintenance reports
- Offers real-time dashboards for engineers and managers

All deployed in a production-grade stack (FastAPI + Streamlit + Docker + Cloud).

##  Key Features

|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  RUL Prediction            | Predicts Remaining Useful Life using NASA CMAPSS sensor data                |
|  FastAPI Backend           | RESTful API for serving RUL predictions                                     |
|  Streamlit Dashboard       | Real-time dashboard with sensor visualizations + decision outcomes         |
| LangChain Agent           | Makes autonomous decisions based on RUL and sensor health                   |
| GPT-4 Maintenance Reports | Generates human-readable insights from raw predictions                     |
| Dockerized & Cloud-ready  | Easy to deploy on Render, GCP, AWS, or Docker Desktop                        |
